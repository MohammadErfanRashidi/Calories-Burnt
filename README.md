# Calorie Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a RandomForestRegressor model to predict calories burned during exercise. It leverages features like age, gender, heart rate, body temperature, duration, and weight, using datasets 'exercise.csv' and 'calories.csv'.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Datasets are loaded and preprocessed using pandas, including encoding gender and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations like histograms and joint plots are used to understand data distributions and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering:** The 'Calories' column is added to the main dataset.
4. **Model Selection:** RandomForestRegressor is chosen for prediction.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Data is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained and evaluated using metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
6. **Visualization of Results:** Actual vs. predicted values are visualized using scatter plots and line plots.

**Dependencies:**

* Python 3
* pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

Install using: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`

**Usage:**

1. Upload 'exercise.csv' and 'calories.csv' to your Colab environment.
2. Copy and paste the code into your Colab notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

**Results:**

* R-squared: [Insert R-squared value]
* MAE: [Insert MAE value]
* RMSE: [Insert RMSE value]

These results indicate [Interpret the results].

**Further Improvements:**

* Explore other regression models.
* Perform hyperparameter tuning.
* Address potential biases.
